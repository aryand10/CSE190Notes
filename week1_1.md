# The Secret Bias Hidden in Mortgage-Approval Algorithms

## Key Points

- Investigation found lenders more likely to deny home loans to people of color compared to White people with similar financial characteristics
- Analysis controlled for 17 factors in over 2 million conventional mortgage applications
- Disparities persisted even when accounting for newly available financial factors industry said would explain differences

## Denial Rates Compared to White Applicants

- Latino applicants: 40% more likely to be denied
- Asian/Pacific Islander applicants: 50% more likely  
- Native American applicants: 70% more likely
- Black applicants: 80% more likely

## Case Study: Crystal Marie and Eskias McDaniels

- Black couple in Charlotte, NC denied mortgage despite:
  - Good credit scores (805 and 725)
  - Six-figure incomes each
  - Substantial savings for down payment
- Told they didn't qualify because Crystal Marie was a contractor
- Eventually approved after pushing back against denial

## Geographic Disparities

- Found disparities in 89 metropolitan areas across the US
- Examples:
  - Charlotte: Black applicants 50% more likely to be denied
  - Chicago: Black applicants 150% more likely to be denied 
  - Waco, TX: Latino applicants 200% more likely to be denied
  - Port St. Lucie, FL: Asian/Pacific Islander applicants 200% more likely to be denied
  - Minneapolis: Native American applicants 100% more likely to be denied

## Role of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae

- Buy about half of all mortgages in America
- Set rules for the industry, including:
  - Requiring use of "Classic FICO" credit scoring algorithm
  - Using automated underwriting software

## Issues with Credit Scoring

- Classic FICO algorithm developed from 1990s data, over 15 years old
- Criticized as detrimental to people of color:
  - Rewards traditional credit, which White Americans have more access to
  - Doesn't consider on-time payments for rent, utilities, cell phone bills
  - Penalizes for past medical debt even if paid off
- Newer models could provide credit to 37 million more Americans
  - Nearly 1/3 would be Black or Latino

## Automated Underwriting Software

- Launched in 1995, touted as fair and "color blind"
- Research shows some factors affect people differently based on race/ethnicity:
  - Credit histories
  - Assets
  - Employment status
  - Debts
  - Loan-to-value ratio
- Algorithms are proprietary, lack transparency

## Legal Framework

- Fair Housing Act (1968)
- Equal Credit Opportunity Act (1974)
- Community Reinvestment Act (1977)
- Enforcement and investigations have decreased over past decade

## Potential Solutions

- Better enforcement of existing laws
- More investigations into discrimination
- Reform of Community Reinvestment Act
- Legislation to criminalize lending discrimination
- Reconsidering value system in mortgage lending

## Conclusion

- Racial disparities persist in mortgage lending despite laws against discrimination
- Complex mix of historical factors, current practices, and opaque algorithms contribute to problem
- More transparency, updated methods, and stronger enforcement may be needed to address issues
